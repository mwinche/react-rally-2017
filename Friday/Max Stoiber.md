Max Stoiber - I want you to contribute to open source
=====================================================

@mxstbr

* How to contribute to open source? Solve your own problems
  * Have a problem
  * Solve a problem (generalized)
  * Share the solution
* Protip: Ask yourself "Can I make it open source?"
* Check if its already been open sourced first
* "If you learn something, please write a blog post"
* He has a few examples of things he's open sourced and how he arrived at open sourcing them
* Writing good documentation is very very hard
* Improving documentation is a great (and very valuable) first contribution
* "I have 100,000 repos on github that noone ever uses, do I care? No! I do it for myself"
* Don't compare yourself unfairly (he was employed to work on open source during his most active time)
