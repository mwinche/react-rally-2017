Cameron Matheson - GraphQL IRL
==============================

@cmatheson

* Do I need a graph db to use GraphQL? No, no you don't
* GraphQL can be backed by REST APIs
* Same benefits of GraphQL which apply to the front end can benefit the back end
* Opinion: Do GraphQL as a first class API
* GraphQL is Types and Resolvers
* GraphiQL (UI for exploring GraphQL)
* Good live example of working with GraphQL
* Make sure to batch load your data
* Don't back it with a REST API unless you have to (IMO to migrate from REST)
* Follow the Relay schema conventions
