Jennifer Van - Scaling My First Enterprise React App! üêô
========================================================

@sugargreenbean

* Enterprise. Means it will persist (it's gonna stick around)
* Growth
* Tested
* To scale (product, dev team and ...)
    * Scaling incorrectly is a dumpster fire
* As a product grows do you keep React fast
* Seperate presentation components out
* Use performance timeline to find and remove unnecessary renders
  * should component update is your friend
* Make your app seem faster
  * Prioritize network calls
* How to keep redux fast
  * setState is okay
  * connect at multiple components
  * normalize state shape (analyze how hard it is to diff)
* Documentation (maintainability)
* Use type systems (Typescript/Flow)
* Test react/redux
