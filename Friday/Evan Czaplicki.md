* Birds and the Bees (no not that)
  * "Who does wings better?"
  * You could look at chitin vs feathers
  * But that's the wrong question
  * The question is: "How does each benefit their design"
* Elm and React
* Virtual DOM
  * React has a special syntax (JSX)
  * Elm has no special syntax (for Virtual DOM)
  * The templating language for Elm is Elm
* Not saying that Elm or React is better than the other
  * Rather that the things that they have in common are probably good ideas
    * Virtual DOM
    * Unidirectional flow
    * Immutability
    * Static Analysis
