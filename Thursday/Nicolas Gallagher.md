* React native web is awesome and works really well
* CSS is a huge drawback of react-dom (and DOM in general)
* What about SSR? (me)
* How performant is it? (me)
* Better for I18N (RTL)
* Better for Accessibility
* Loads less rules (one class per rule under the hood)
* There are some escape hatches for accessing the DOM
  * Should just be used for migrations IMO and treated as technical debt
* Universal components (holy grail IMO)
