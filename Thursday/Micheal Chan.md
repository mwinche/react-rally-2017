Micheal Chan - Back to React: The Story of Two Apps
===================================================

* React used to be billed as the "V" in MVC
* We'd tack it onto other stacks (Rails, Backbone, etc)
* It was the "missing piece" (The missing piece and the big O by Shel Silverstein)
* React had some sharp edges (state, async, styling, etc)
* Started learning how to solve those problems better
* Gained higher tolerance for JIT solutions
  * Only extract or share a component once it becomes a problem
* Five Liberating Constraints:
  * Know who's driving (know who's mouth you're in XD)
    * What role does React play in your app?
  * Optimize for change ("Do it now" vs "F*** it")
  * Know your shapes
    * Master the patterns
    * Knowing/unknowing components
    * High-order components vs callbacks (know both)
  * Avoid the edges
    * "Don't for it's not the edge that's bleeding, it's you." - Ryan Florence
    * Change when you need to
    * Choose tools you can master
  * Partner, don't depend
    * Debugging is twice as hard as writing code
    * Stop delegating to open source libraries
    * When you `npm install` that code is yours now, get good at it and own it
    * Guard your stack, be purposeful about what makes it in your application
